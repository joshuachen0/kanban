Aspects:

1. Allow user to specify number of columns and rows that correspond to the number of possible areas a kanban is in and the number of kanbans that can be in an area. Specify as a dictionary? (area name, max size of area)
2. Make it run continuously, but also be able to save kanbans. Record kanban data with data in text files.
3. Make a nice text display for listing the kanbans, both in total, in a single area, and a single kanban.
4. Draw out on paper what needs to be done for every kanban (i.e. what input we need from the user for a kanban). Also draw out the text display of the kanbans and areas.
5. FUTURE: make graphical interface.
